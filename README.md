Report on Bridge Pattern Implementation
1. Introduction

In this report, I will demonstrate the use of the Bridge Pattern in the context of organizing events. The problem involves handling different types of events (e.g., Exhibition, Concert) with varying ways of organizing them (either physically at a location or online). The goal is to separate the event type (abstraction) from the method of organization (implementation), so that both can evolve independently.

2. Organizer Interface

The Organizer interface defines a method organize(), which is responsible for organizing the event. This allows us to define different ways to organize events, such as physical location or online, without changing the event abstraction itself.

3. Concrete Implementations: Physical and Online Organizers

These are the concrete implementations of the Organizer interface. Each of these classes defines how an event is organized, either at a physical location or online.

4. Event (Abstraction)

The Event class is the abstraction. It holds a reference to an Organizer object and delegates the task of organizing the event to the Organizer. The planEvent() method is abstract and must be implemented by subclasses.

5. Refined Abstractions: Exhibition and Concert

These are specific types of events that extend the Event class. Each class implements the planEvent() method and delegates the organization of the event to the organizer.

6. Main Class (Usage)

The Main class demonstrates how different event types are created and organized using the Bridge Pattern. Each event is planned with a specific organizer (either physical or online).

7. Advantages of the Bridge Pattern

Separation of Concerns: The event logic (types of events) is separated from the organization method (physical or online).

Flexibility: You can easily add new event types or new ways of organizing events without affecting the existing code.

Extensibility: New RefinedAbstraction (event types) or ConcreteImplementor (organizers) can be added easily without modifying existing code.

8. Conclusion

In this report, I have demonstrated how the Bridge Pattern can be applied to the problem of organizing events. By separating the abstraction (event types) from the implementation (organizing methods), the system becomes more flexible and easier to extend. This pattern reduces the complexity of the code and helps avoid a combinatorial explosion of classes, making the design more maintainable and scalable.
